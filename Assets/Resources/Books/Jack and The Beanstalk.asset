  title: Jack and The Beanstalk
  summary: Jack and The Beanstalk summary
  story: "Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack\u2019s
    mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way
    he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, \u201CWhat will you give
    me in return for my cow?\u201D The man answered, \u201CI will give you five magic
    beans!\u201D Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he
    reached home, Jack\u2019s mother was very angry. She said, \u201CYou fool! He
    took away your cow and gave you some beans!\u201D She threw the beans out of
    the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.  The next day,
    when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a
    huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and
    reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside
    the house and found the giant\u2019s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, \u201CCould
    you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!\u201D The kind wife gave
    him bread and some milk.  While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant
    was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went and hid inside.
    The giant cried, \u201CFee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be
    he alive, or be he dead, I\u2019ll grind his bones to make my bread!\u201D The
    wife said, \u201CThere is no boy in here!\u201D So, the giant ate his food and
    then went to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and
    kept them aside. Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding
    place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home, he
    gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for
    sometime.  Jack and the Beanstalk Fee Fi Fo Fum!Climbed the beanstalk and went
    to the giant\u2019s house again. Once again, Jack asked the giant\u2019s wife
    for food, but while he was eating the giant returned. Jack leapt up in fright
    and went and hid under the bed. The giant cried, \u201CFee-fifo-fum, I smell
    the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I\u2019ll grind his bones
    to make my bread!\u201D The wife said, \u201CThere is no boy in here!\u201D The
    giant ate his food and went to his room. There, he took out a hen. He shouted,
    \u201CLay!\u201D and the hen laid a golden egg. When the giant fell asleep, Jack
    took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk. Jack\u2019s mother was very happy
    with him.  After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to
    the giant\u2019s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant\u2019s wife and
    asked for some food. Once again, the giant\u2019s wife gave him bread and milk.
    But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. \u201CFee-fi-fo-fum, I smell
    the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I\u2019ll grind his bones
    to make my bread!\u201D cried the giant. \u201CDon\u2019t be silly! There is
    no boy in here!\u201D said his wife.  The giant had a magical harp that could
    play beautiful songs. While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about
    to leave. Suddenly, the magic harp cried, \u201CHelp master! A boy is stealing
    me!\u201D The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after
    Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home.
    The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an
    axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died.  Jack and his mother
    were now very rich and they lived happily ever after."
